# Fuzzle

> I came up with a sequence puzzle (e.g. what's the next number in the sequence).  I asked some friends if they could solve it, but in the back of my mind I kept wondering if I'd added everything correctly.  So I wrote this to check myself.

## Usage

1. Print out however many digits you want to get initially. Let's do five.

    ```
    $ node fuzzle.js 5
    ```

1. Try to figure out what the pattern is, compute the next value, and then check yourself.

    ```
    $ node fuzzle.js 6
    ```

1. Eventually give up and look at the sourcecode.
